# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I didnt really struggle much with this as its just rinse and repeat
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Im finding that writing down the initial abse formula down the most helpful so i can go and look back it. Other than that the more i do it the faster i learn
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Im doing my best to solve on my own, then i ask my small group, then i go to google!
